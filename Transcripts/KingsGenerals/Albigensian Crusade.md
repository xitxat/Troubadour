## 12th Century

### Places

* Languedoc
* City of **Albi**

### People

* **Cathar Perfects**
* **Cathar Believers**

### Events

* Catharism gains a strong foothold in Languedoc, especially in Albi.
* Because of Albi, Cathars become known as **Albigensians**.
* Cathar dualist belief:

  * A *good* God created the spiritual world.
  * An *evil* God (Satan) created the material world.
* Ultimate spiritual goal: escape the flesh and rejoin the pure spiritual realm.
* **Perfects** live in strict poverty, simplicity, and sexual abstinence.
* **Believers** follow a looser version of the teachings; Catharism spreads among:

  * farmers
  * city artisans
  * some feudal lords

## Early 13th Century

### Places

* Languedoc
* Local castra (fortified towns and cities)

### People

* Local Catholic clergy
* **Pope Innocent III**
* Languedoc nobility and barons
* Members of the aristocracy (including women) who become Cathar Perfects

### Events

* Catholic clergy and papacy grow increasingly alarmed by Cathar expansion.
* Cathars openly defy Catholic dogma and keep gaining followers.
* Reasons many nobles side with or protect Cathars:

  * Cathar priests and bishops demand lower tithes and taxes than Catholic clergy.
  * Several aristocrats, especially noblewomen, convert and even live as Perfects, giving Cathars influential advocates.
  * Local lords in Languedoc are keen to protect their culture, language, customs, and economic independence from:

    * Kings of France and Aragon
    * Papacy
    * Northern barons
* Fortified **castra** allow Languedoc nobles to act largely independently from their theoretical overlords.
* Refusing to persecute Cathars is also a political act: resisting external interference by kings and popes.
* In the first decade of the 13th century, tensions rise as **Pope Innocent III** becomes determined to crush the “heresy,” while northern barons view a crusade as an opportunity for territorial expansion in Languedoc.

## 1208 January 13

### Places

* Languedoc region
* Along the Rhône River (location of the murder, following day)

### People

* **Peter of Castelnau** – papal legate / envoy of Pope Innocent III
* **Pope Innocent III** – head of the Catholic Church and Papal States (1198–1216)
* **Raymond VI**, Count of Toulouse

### Events

* Peter of Castelnau confronts Raymond VI and his vassals for failing to act against the Cathar heresy in Languedoc.
* Raymond responds badly, refuses to act, and threatens Peter’s life.
* The following day, while travelling along the Rhône, Peter of Castelnau is killed by a mounted spearman.
* The murder becomes the spark that ignites the **Albigensian Crusade**, the first crusade waged primarily against fellow Christians, leading to a ~20-year conflict with massive, often described as genocidal, casualties.
* **Pope Innocent III** issues a call for a crusade against the Albigensian heretics.
* The Pope first asks **King Philip Augustus** of France and his son **Louis** to lead the expedition; the French Crown declines direct participation due to conflicts with King John of England and the Angevin Empire, but allows French lords to join with their own forces.

## 1209 June 24

### Places

* **Lyon**

### People

* Northern French barons and lords
* **Papal legate Arnald Amaury**
* **William of Tudela** (chronicler, later source for troop figures)

### Events

* Under papal legate Arnald Amaury, northern barons, knights, and their forces assemble at Lyon in response to the crusade call.
* Many are motivated by:

  * Papal promise of spiritual salvation (indulgence after 40 days’ service).
  * Right to keep goods and territory taken from “heretics.”
* Official terms:

  * 40 days of service earns full indulgence.
  * Crusaders may retain plunder, including land in Languedoc.
* Contemporary chronicler William of Tudela claims 20,000 knights and 200,000 foot soldiers; more realistic modern estimates suggest the total force likely never exceeded around 20,000 troops at any one time, with numbers fluctuating as contingents joined and left due to the 40-day rule.
* Southern (pro-Cathar) forces are harder to estimate because many lords switch sides opportunistically.

## 1209 July 2

### Places

* **Valence**
* **Montpellier**

### People

* **Arnald Amaury**, papal legate
* **Raymond VI of Toulouse**
* **Raymond-Roger Trencavel**, Viscount of Béziers and Carcassonne

### Events

* Crusader column reaches **Valence**.
* **Raymond VI**, previously hostile to the papal legates, submits and pledges allegiance to Arnald Amaury, asking to join the crusade.
* At **Montpellier**, **Raymond-Roger Trencavel** also approaches Amaury, requesting to join the fight against heresy.
* Trencavel admits there are many Cathars in his lands but claims he has not supported them.
* Amaury refuses him and declares that neither Trencavel nor Béziers will receive mercy from the Church.
* Forced into opposition, Trencavel rides back to **Béziers** to organise its defence:

  * Strengthens defensive ditches
  * Orders militia to defend the bridge over the river **Orb**
  * Closes the city gates
* Trencavel then rides to **Carcassonne** to seek reinforcements.

* **Béziers**
* River **Orb**

### People

* **Raymond-Roger Trencavel** (absent, seeking reinforcements)

### Events

* Before Trencavel can return, the crusader army arrives at **Béziers** on **21 July 1209**.
* Deployment:

  * Nobles, knights, and well-equipped men-at-arms camp on a sandy plain southwest of the citadel, at a safe distance from sorties.
  * Mercenaries and poor crusaders set up camp near the river and closer to the gates.
* Crusaders first attempt negotiation:

  * The **Bishop of Béziers** urges citizens to surrender.
  * The citizens respond they would rather be drowned in the salt sea than yield “a penny worth” of their possessions.
* The defenders rely on their strong walls and ditches and expect to outlast the **40-day** service term for most crusaders.

## 1209 July 22

### Places

* **Béziers**
* River **Orb**
* **St Nazaire Cathedral**
* **St Mary Magdalene Church**

### People

* Young militiamen of Béziers
* Ribaud camp leaders
* Mercenary routiers
* Crusader knights
* **Arnald Amaury**, papal legate
* Citizens of Béziers (Cathars and Catholics alike)

### Events

* Early morning, a group of impatient young Béziers militiamen sortie from the city, attacking the ribaud camp and clashing with mercenaries on the bridge over the **Orb**.
* Alarmed ribaud leaders order an immediate assault on the city; mercenaries join in.
* In the chaos, some mercenaries force their way into Béziers before the gates can be closed, climb the walls, and engage the defenders.
* Mercenaries spread through the streets, killing and looting with little resistance.
* Hundreds of citizens seek refuge in the churches, notably **St Nazaire Cathedral** and **St Mary Magdalene**.
* Mercenaries and then knights massacre inhabitants indiscriminately, including women, children, and clergy.
* When knights ask how to distinguish Catholics from Cathars, **Arnald Amaury** reportedly answers:

  > “Kill them all. The Lord knows who are his own.”
* Mass killing follows; **around 1,000 people are slaughtered in St Mary Magdalene alone**.
* Knights confiscate loot from ribauds and mercenaries; in protest, the poorer crusaders set fire to timber buildings.
* In a matter of hours, **Béziers**, a major pro-Cathar centre, is destroyed and thousands—both Cathars and Catholics—are killed.
* Emboldened, the crusaders march toward their next target: **Carcassonne**, about 80 km to the southwest.

## 1209 August 1

### Places

* **Carcassonne**
* River **Aude**

### People

* **Simon IV de Montfort**, northern nobleman, veteran of the Holy Land
* **Raymond-Roger Trencavel**, Viscount of Carcassonne
* Crusader host

### Events

* Leadership of the siege of Carcassonne passes to **Simon de Montfort**.
* Like Béziers, Carcassonne has strong walls and defences.
* Key weakness: main water supply from the **Aude**, roughly 400 m outside the walls.
* On **1 August 1209**, the crusader army quickly surrounds Carcassonne and cuts the defenders off from the river.

---

## 1209 August 2

### Places

* Carcassonne – **Bourg** suburb (west of main city)

### People

* **Raymond-Roger Trencavel**
* Crusader forces

### Events

* Crusaders launch first attack against the **Bourg**, an unfortified western suburb.
* Trencavel has already evacuated this suburb, recognising it is indefensible.
* De Montfort’s men storm and burn the **Bourg** within about two hours.
* They then turn to a northern detached suburb, the **Castellar**, which is well-protected by ditches and high fortifications.

---

## 1209 August 8

### Places

* Carcassonne – **Castellar** suburb

### People

* **Simon de Montfort**
* Defenders of Carcassonne

### Events

* Defenders of the **Castellar** bombard the attackers with stones and crossbow bolts.
* Crusaders respond by building siege engines:

  * **Mangonels** for low-trajectory rock bombardment.
  * A mobile wooden **“cat”**, covered in fireproof hides to protect troops approaching the walls.
* On **8 August**, the besiegers breach the walls of the **Castellar**, storm the area, and push defenders back into the main city.
* De Montfort leaves only a small force to hold Castellar.
* Trencavel’s men launch a sortie, successfully burning the Castellar and then retreating into Carcassonne.
* A stalemate follows:

  * Crusaders cannot break the main walls.
  * Defenders suffer from heat, dehydration, and dysentery inside the city.

---

## 1209 August 14

### Places

* **Carcassonne** (crusader camp and city)

### People

* **Raymond-Roger Trencavel**, Viscount of Carcassonne
* **King Peter II of Aragon**
* **Arnald Amaury** (legate)
* Count of Nevers
* **Simon de Montfort** (crusader military leader)

### Events

* Trencavel and Carcassonne are nominal vassals of **King Peter II of Aragon**.
* Concerned by northern French forces ravaging his vassals’ lands, Peter II attempts to mediate.
* The King brings a proposal from the papal legate **Amaury**:

  * Trencavel and 11 followers spared.
  * All other inhabitants to be killed.
* Trencavel rejects this offer; fighting resumes.
* Crusaders attempt direct assaults:

  * Filling ditches with wood bundles.
  * Scaling walls under fire from bolts, stones, and boiling oil.
* Time pressure mounts on both sides:

  * Crusaders face the expiration of many 40-day service terms.
  * Defenders face dwindling water and widespread dysentery.
* On **14 August**, Trencavel enters the crusader camp to negotiate again with the **Count of Nevers** and legate **Amaury**.
* New terms: citizens of Carcassonne—Catholics and Cathars alike—will be spared if they leave the city immediately with no possessions.
* Trencavel accepts to save his city.
* Citizens are expelled and stripped of goods.
* Trencavel himself is imprisoned and later dies of dysentery that same year.
* Within less than two months, the crusaders have taken two key pro-Cathar strongholds: **Béziers** and **Carcassonne**.
* Carcassonne’s strategic location and strong defences make it the crusader headquarters for the rest of the campaign.
* Leadership issue:

  * With many nobles eager to return home at the end of their service, powerful lords (e.g., the Duke of Burgundy) refuse command.
  * Long-term command of the crusader army eventually falls to **Simon de Montfort**, who becomes the main military leader in the early phase of the Albigensian Crusade.

---

## 1209 (Late)

### Places

* Languedoc: **Castres**, **Fanjoux**, **Puy-la-Roque**, **Mirepoix**, **Saverdun**, **Albi**, and other castra

### People

* **Simon de Montfort**
* Local southern lords

### Events

* Through the remainder of **1209**, de Montfort leads campaigns across Languedoc, capturing numerous castra.
* His army’s reputation for military superiority and brutality—established at Béziers and Carcassonne—causes many towns to surrender with little or no resistance.
* Cities and castra such as **Castres**, **Fanjoux**, **Puy-la-Roque**, **Mirepoix**, **Saverdun**, and even **Albi** open their gates or offer token resistance.
* **Albi**, once an early centre of Catharism, pledges allegiance to the northern crusaders.
* Success becomes a double-edged sword:

  * De Montfort must leave garrisons in each new stronghold.
  * His field army steadily shrinks, leaving him increasingly vulnerable to any coordinated southern resurgence.
